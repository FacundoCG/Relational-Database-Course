# Relational Database Course Repository

Welcome to my Relational Database Course Repository! This repository contains all the projects completed during my journey through the Relational Database course. Throughout the course, I utilized real developer tools such as VS Code, PostgreSQL, and the Linux/Unix command line to delve into interactive tutorials and build practical projects.

In this course, I embarked on a comprehensive journey through relational databases using PostgreSQL and SQL. Starting with fundamental Bash commands, I navigated through the terminal, mastering file system manipulation and Bash scripting. Progressing further, I delved into advanced topics including database creation, management, and querying using SQL.

## Projects Summary

### 1. Universe database: 
This project involves creating a relational database named "universe" that models various celestial objects such as galaxies, stars, planets, and moons.

### 2. Bash Scripting
This project comprises five Bash scripts designed for automation and interaction:

- **bingo.sh**: Generates random Bingo numbers categorized into B, I, N, G, or O groups.
- **countdown.sh**: Counts down from a given positive integer to zero, displaying each countdown value.
- **fortune.sh**: Predicts fortunes in response to yes-or-no questions with random responses.
- **questionnaire.sh**: Collects user information through three questions and displays a summary.
- **five.sh**: A master script executing all four scripts sequentially, providing convenience in running them together.

### 3. Students Database
This project involves managing a student database with PostgreSQL. It includes:

- **Database Schema:** Defines tables, relationships, and constraints.
- **Data Insertion Script:** Inserts data from CSV files into the database.
- **Student Information Script:** Queries student and course data.

### 4. World Cup Database
This project involves managing a PostgreSQL database for World Cup data. It comprises:

- **Schema Definition:** Defines tables for storing game and team details.
- **Data Insertion Script:** Inserts data from CSV files into the database.
- **Queries Script:** Executes SQL queries for data analysis.

### 5. Kitty Ipsum Translator
The `translate.sh` script translates kitty ipsum into dog-themed text. 

### 6. Bike Rental Shop
The Bike Rental Shop CLI is a command-line interface (CLI) designed for managing bike rentals in a rental shop. It allows users to rent and return bikes interactively by communicating with a PostgreSQL database.

### 7. Salon Appointment Scheduler
The Salon Appointment Scheduler CLI is a command-line interface (CLI) developed for managing salon appointments effectively. It enables users to schedule, update, and cancel appointments seamlessly. The CLI interacts with a PostgreSQL database to store and retrieve appointment details, customer information, and service selections.

### 8. Periodic Table Database
The Periodic Table CLI is a command-line tool that provides information about chemical elements. Designed by me, it interacts with a PostgreSQL database containing data on elements, including their atomic mass, melting point, boiling point, and classification.

### 9. Number Guessing Game
The Number Guessing Game is an interactive command-line game designed to entertain users by challenging them to guess a secret number between 1 and 1000. I developed the game and integrated it with a PostgreSQL database to track users' game statistics, including the number of games played and their best game score.
